        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It is the foundation of every webpage you visit, providing the structure, content, and layout for all kinds of web pages. HTML allows the web to be interactive, dynamic, and functional by integrating with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript.</p>
